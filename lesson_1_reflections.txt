 How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped me in comparing the two files side by side and point out the difference between them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It helps us to effectively debug the program. It also help us with improving the feature over the old code by looking at the history of that program.
